DeepaMehta 3
============

DeepaMehta 3 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.

Technologically DeepaMehta is made of Java, Neo4j, Apache Lucene, Apache Felix, Jersey, Javascript/AJAX, jQuery, jQuery-UI, TinyMCE, and HTML5 Canvas.

Requirements
------------

* Java 1.6

* A "modern" webbrowser.  
  Works fine with Firefox 3.6 and Safari 5. Works mostly fine with Chrome 5 or higher.  
  Doesn't work with IE8. Potentially works with IE9.


Install
-------

1. Download latest release from here:  
   <http://github.com/jri/deepamehta3/downloads/>

2. Unpack zip archive.  
   A folder *deepamehta3* is created.


Start
-----

1. Open the *deepamehta3* folder and use the respective starter script for your platform:

        deepamehta-linux.sh         # choose "Run in terminal"
        deepamehta-mac.command      # double-click it
        deepamehta-windows.bat      # double-click it

   A terminal window opens and you see some information logged.  
   Wait until the logging has finished.

2. Visit DeepaMehta in your webbrowser:  
   <http://localhost:8080/de.deepamehta.3-client/index.html>


Stop
----

Go to the terminal window that opened while startup and type:

    exit 0

This puts the database in a consistent state.  
You can close the terminal window now.


Update
------

To update a previous DeepaMehta installation and keep all your data:

1. Stop old DeepaMehta (if running).

2. Download and unpack new DeepaMehta at another location (or rename the old DeepaMehta folder before).

3. Replace the new *deepamehta-db* folder with a copy of your old one.

4. Start the new DeepaMehta (by using the respective starter script).  
   DeepaMehta now automatically migrates your old data to the new format.  
   Wait until the logging has finished.

5. **IMPORTANT:** now stop DeepaMehta and start it again (only now the memory cache is up-to-date).  
   Sorry for this extra step!

6. You're done. Visit DeepaMehta in your webbrowser:  
   <http://localhost:8080/de.deepamehta.3-client/index.html>

Please Note:

* **You can only update a stable DeepaMehta release.** Updating a snapshot release is not supported.  
  The first updatable version is DeepaMehta 3 v0.4. Updating DeepaMehta v0.3 is not suppported.

* Keep your old *deepamehta-db* folder at a safe place.  
  You'll need it as a backup when something went wrong while migration.


Uninstall
---------

Stop DeepaMehta and delete the *deepamehta3* folder.  
This removes DeepaMehta completely from your computer, including the database with all your data.
