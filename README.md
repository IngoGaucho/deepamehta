DeepaMehta 4
============

DeepaMehta 4 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.

Technically DeepaMehta 4 is made of  
Java, Neo4j, Apache Lucene, Apache Felix, Jetty, Jersey (server-side),  
Javascript/AJAX, jQuery, jQuery-UI, HTML5 Canvas, and TinyMCE (client-side).

DeepaMehta 4 is a rewrite of DeepaMehta 2.  
(DeepaMehta 3 was a research & development effort.)

Requirements
------------

**Java 1.6** and a "modern" **webbrowser**.

Works fine with Firefox 3.6 (or newer) and Safari 5. Works mostly fine with Chrome 5 (or newer).  
Doesn't work with IE8. Potentially works with IE9.


Install
-------

Download the latest release and unzip it.  
<https://github.com/jri/deepamehta/downloads/>

A folder `deepamehta-4.0.2` is created.


Start
-----

Open the `deepamehta-4.0.2` folder and use the respective starter script for your platform:

    deepamehta-linux.sh         # choose "Run in terminal"
    deepamehta-macosx.command   # double-click it
    deepamehta-windows.bat      # double-click it

While DeepaMehta starts a terminal window opens and you see some information logged.  
Then a browser window opens and DeepaMehta is ready to use.

Hint: if no browser window appears open it manually:  
<http://localhost:8080/de.deepamehta.webclient/index.html>


Stop
----

Go to the terminal window that opened while startup and type:

    stop 0

This puts the database in a consistent state.  
You can close the terminal window now.


Update
------

To update from DeepaMehta 4.0 or 4.0.1 to 4.0.2 while keeping your content: before starting DeepaMehta copy your `deepamehta-db` folder into the `deepamehta-4.0.2` folder. (If you've started DeepaMehta 4.0.2 already, stop it, and replace its `deepamehta-db` folder with your one, and start again.)

Updating from DeepaMehta 2 or 3 to DeepaMehta 4 is currently not supported.


Start with a fresh database
---------------------------

Stop DeepaMehta, remove the `deepamehta-db` folder, and start again.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If the browser shows 404 or 503 while an exception appears in the terminal: refresh the `Apache Felix Http Jetty` bundle by typing `refresh 1` in the terminal (checkout the proper bundle ID before by using the `lb` command).


Uninstall
---------

Stop DeepaMehta and delete the `deepamehta-4.0.2` folder.  
This removes DeepaMehta completely from your computer, including the database.

Version History
---------------

**4.0.2** -- Aug 2, 2011

* Bug fix: proper character encoding (when using the binary distribution in a client/server setup)

**4.0.1** -- Jul 28, 2011

* Bug fix: retyping an association does not compromise role types

**4.0** -- Jul 24, 2011

* Complete new property-less data model. All values are represented as reusable semantics-attached topics.  
  <https://groups.google.com/group/deepamehta3/browse_thread/thread/a77704d35e7af539>
* Improvements for users:
    * new type editor
    * new topic type "Resource" for collecting web resources
    * cleaner display, less clutter
    * new icons
* Improvements for developers:
    * New core service API. All the domain objects (Topic, Association, ...) are attached to the database.
      So, the developer must not care about DB-updates.
    * Domain models (type definitions) provided by a plugin can be build upon the domain models
      provided by other plugins. The dependencies are handled by the framework.

  The version planned as "DeepaMehta 3 v0.5" eventually become "DeepaMehta 4.0".  
  From now on DeepaMehta version numbers follow the classic *major*.*minor*.*bugfix* schema.
