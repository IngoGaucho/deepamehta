DeepaMehta 3
============

DeepaMehta 3 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.

Technically DeepaMehta 3 is made of  
Java, Neo4j, Apache Lucene, Apache Felix, Jetty, Jersey (server-side),  
Javascript/AJAX, jQuery, jQuery-UI, HTML5 Canvas, and TinyMCE (client-side).

DeepaMehta 3 is a rewrite of DeepaMehta 2.

Requirements
------------

* Java 1.6

* A "modern" webbrowser.

  Works fine with Firefox 3.6 and Safari 5. Works mostly fine with Chrome 5 or higher.  
  Doesn't work with IE8. Potentially works with IE9.


Installing
----------

1. Download latest release from here:  
   <http://github.com/jri/deepamehta3/downloads/>

2. Unpack zip archive.  
   A folder *deepamehta3-v0.4.4* is created.


Starting
--------

1. Open the *deepamehta3-v0.4.4* folder and use the respective starter script for your platform:

        deepamehta-linux.sh         # choose "Run in terminal"
        deepamehta-macosx.command   # double-click it
        deepamehta-windows.bat      # double-click it

   While the server starts a terminal window opens and you see some information logged.  
   Then a browser window opens and DeepaMehta is ready to use.

   Note: to open the DeepaMehta browser window manually use this address:  
   <http://localhost:8080/de.deepamehta.3-webclient/index.html>


Stopping
--------

1. Go to the terminal window that opened while startup and type:

        exit 0

   This puts the database in a consistent state.  
   You can close the terminal window now.


Updating
--------

To update a previous DeepaMehta installation and keep your database:

1. Stop DeepaMehta (if running).

2. Download and unpack the new DeepaMehta version.

3. Replace its *deepamehta-db* folder with a copy of your current one.

4. Start the new DeepaMehta (as described above).  
   Your database automatically migrates to the new format.  
   Wait until the logging has finished.

5. **IMPORTANT:** stop DeepaMehta and start it again (as described above).  
   (Now the memory cache is up-to-date.) Sorry for this extra step!

6. You're done. The DeepaMehta browser window opens automatically.

Please Note:

* **You can only update a stable DeepaMehta release.** Updating a snapshot release is not supported.  
  The first updatable version is DeepaMehta 3 v0.4. Updating DeepaMehta v0.3 is not suppported.

* Keep your old *deepamehta-db* folder at a safe place.  
  You'll need it as a backup when something went wrong while migration.


Uninstalling
------------

Stop DeepaMehta and delete the *deepamehta3-v0.4.4* folder.  
This removes DeepaMehta completely from your computer, including your database.
